Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function, making day-to-day tasks considerably more 
challenging. Memory loss is often the first symptom of Alzheimer's disease, especially the difficulty to remember recently learned information.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images. 
It is particularly powerful in tasks like image recognition and classification.

Used CNN models namely ResNet50 and EfficientNet B0 to detect alzheimers.

RESNET-50
ResNet-50, also known as Residual Network with 50 layers, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of training 
incredibly deep neural networks.
